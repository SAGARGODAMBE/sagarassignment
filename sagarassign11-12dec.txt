Answer to Question 6 
=====
String pool is a storage area in Java heap where string literals are stored. 
It is just like object allocation so to decrease the number of String objects 
created in the JVM, the String class keeps a pool of strings.
Each time a string literal is created, the JVM checks the string literal pool first. 
If the string already exists in the string pool, a reference to the pooled instance 
returns. If the string does not exist in the pool, a new String object initializes 
and is placed in the pool. 


Answer to Question 5 
===========

A String variable contains a collection of characters surrounded by double quotes.
It is actually an object of the class String in java.
The string class contain methods that can perform certain operations on strings.Some of which are lenth(),indexOf(),concat()
charAt(),equals(),contains(), etc.
Once created, a string is immutable. Immutable simply means unmodifiable or unchangeable. 
Once String object is created its data or state can't be changed but a new String object is created.
